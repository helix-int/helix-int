**A Closer Look at Our Services**
---------------------------------

Over the years, Helix International's commitment to unlock and transform your data with rugged software at the convergence of documents and data is always unwavering. Here are some of the major services we render to our cherished clients:

### Migration

Helix International has various options and combinations available when you want to migrate data. We have full migration, ad hoc migration, archive data, Helix RealTime Viewer (RTV) Mimic Mode partial migrations, and assisted migrations. All of these services are executed using Helix International on and offshore staff 24/7/365.

### Universal Accessibility

### Accounts Payable / Procure-to-Pay Automation

Large companies have a bunch of suppliers and vendors worldwide who send tons of invoices daily, which is impossible or expensive to process manually. However, Helix International saves such outfits time and money with Procure-to-Pay Automation, where selecting a vendor, sending the purchase order, receiving the goods and the invoice, and then making the payment is computerized. Whenever a vendor sends an invoice, whether, by email, attachment, or fax, it gets automatically read by the software, which triggers some business automation to check the following: a) is this an actual invoice? b) is this one of our vendors? c) did we really send a purchase order for this? 4) does the invoice match what we expect from the purchase order? And if all is satisfactory, it triggers to send the payment automatically. Businesses can complete vendor payments in seconds instead of days, enhance their relationship with vendors, and eliminate costly human errors.

### Sales Processes

We bring a dedicated approach for sales orders to achieve management consolidation, design and deliver custom-made documents when and where you want them, ad-hoc letters or emails to the customer, and mass documents like order validation. It is uncomplicated for us to implement vigorous sales order management solutions that automate sales order processes, reduce costs, and help to grow profits.

This mechanism reduces total freight spending and improves import/export compliance.

### **GDPR Compliance**

The General Data Protection Regulation of 2016 is an EU regulatory guideline for data protection and privacy that comes with heft sanctions in an era of rampant data security breaches. It is jurisdiction blind so far as the data owner is an EU resident.

Stimulatingly, Helix International's operations, MARS Platform, and Managing and viewing data are all GDPR-compliant. Data management across ECM and data repositories with RTV is likewise in keeping with this legislation.

We comply with managing data access/deletion/retention regardless of the destination ECM solution(s) and various repositories employing Helix International MARS Watcher.
