Data is essential for modern businesses, and managing it effectively is crucial for organizations that want to stay competitive. The importance of having a well-defined data strategy cannot be overstated. A data strategy provides a clear set of goals and objectives for managing and utilizing data within an organization and a plan for achieving those goals. It helps to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date and can support data-driven decision-making and other business processes.

In today's world of big data, where businesses are continually collecting and storing large amounts of data from various sources, a data strategy is essential for making sense of this data and extracting value from it. By identifying the critical data sets and establishing processes for collecting, organizing, and analyzing the data, a data strategy can help businesses to uncover insights and trends that can inform their business decisions.

Enterprise Content Management systems (ECMs) can play a critical role in enabling that strategy. In this article, we will explore the role of ECMs in data management and how they can help businesses overcome the challenges of managing unstructured data.

ECMs are powerful tools that provide businesses with a range of capabilities for managing, organizing, and securing their data. They enable enterprises to classify and organize their data, automate data management processes, and protect their data from cyber threats. ECMs also provide tools and capabilities that make it easier to manage and analyze unstructured data, a common challenge for many businesses.

### The Role of ECMs in Data Management

Enterprise Content Management systems provide a range of tools and capabilities to help businesses manage, organize, and secure their data. These systems can be customized to meet the specific needs of each organization.

Classification and organization are key functions of ECMs. These systems provide tools like taxonomies, metadata, and automatic categorization to help businesses understand and manage their data. This makes it easier to retrieve and use data. Data management processes can also be automated using ECMs. For example, ECMs can capture, index, and store data automatically, reducing the need for manual data entry and ensuring that data is consistently organized and up-to-date. This saves time and reduces the risk of errors, making it easier for businesses to make informed decisions based on their data.

ECM systems can also provide tools for managing and securing data. For example, they can offer access controls and permission settings to ensure that only authorized users can access specific data sets. They can also provide encryption and other security features to protect data from unauthorized access or tampering.

With the capabilities for querying and visualizing data, supporting data analysis and reporting is a cinch, helping organizations uncover insights and trends in their data.

### The Challenge of Managing Unstructured Data

A major challenge when it comes to managing unstructured data is the lack of clear structure and organization. Unlike structured data, which is typically stored in a fixed format such as a database or spreadsheet, unstructured data can take many different forms, such as documents, images, videos, and audio files. This can make it difficult to search for and retrieve specific pieces of information and can also make it harder to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data.

The challenges of managing unstructured data can have a significant impact on a data management strategy. The lack of structure and organization can make it difficult to search for and access specific pieces of information, which can, in turn, hinder decision-making and other business processes that rely on the data.

Ensuring the security of unstructured data is also a major challenge. Because unstructured data often contains sensitive information, it is important to have systems in place to protect it from unauthorized access and tampering. This can be a complex task, given the variety of forms that unstructured data can take and the potential for data to be distributed across multiple locations.

While unstructured data lacks a clear structure or organization, modern Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems can provide tools for organizing and applying metadata to the data. This can help to create a more structured and organized view of the data, making it easier to search for and retrieve specific pieces of information. Features like applying tags and labels to the data, classifying and grouping, and indexing the unstructured data based on what's within the data objects are all possible.

### Structure Any Unstructured Data with Helix International

With Helix International's purpose-built proprietary software platform MARS, managing unstructured data is even easier. Data Mining Studio (DMS) component of MARS is capable of extracting data across any filetypes and structuring any unstructured data. MARS DMS can automatically process unstructured data from incoming emails, scanned documents, CRMs, ERPs, and virtually any other data sources.

The software can then extract, label, and structure all information with 100% accuracy and encodes it into the universal XML format. After that, organizations can apply business automation rules and workflows (which can be automated as well), normalizing content for formatting, brand compliance, and content. After that, the finalized data is loaded straight into your chosen systems, including ECM, CRM, and ERP. The results? No more manual document processing for unstructured data takes seconds literally to process and saves millions of cost in both manpower and legacy license fees. 100% data accuracy with touchless automation is a given with Helix International's MARS platform.
