As the new year approaches, many organizations look for ways to improve their operations and boost productivity. One area that often needs to be noticed is the organization's Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system. This is, in fact, the perfect time to assess if you are using your ECM system to its full potential.

If you want to make the most of your ECM system in the new year, here are five resolutions to consider.

### Upgrade or Migrate

The first order of business should be to evaluate if your ECM system is due for an upgrade or a migration. Many organizations still run-on legacy applications while the organization's needs have outgrown the legacy ECM system. Can you find documents and contents as quickly and easily as you need using the current ECM system? Is your ECM system helping or hindering compliance? Are you paying an exorbitant annual licensing fees while also having to pay costly maintenance fees?

Now is the time to migrate if you're still using an outdated or unsupported ECM system. Modern ECM systems come with improved features and capabilities, such as enhanced security, better collaboration tools, and mobile access. By upgrading your ECM system, you can take advantage of these new features and improve the efficiency of your business.

Migrating away from a legacy ECM system sound daunting and complex. With the right ECM migration partner like Helix International, your organization will be reaping the benefits of a modern ECM system in no time.

### Declutter Data

Over time, your ECM system can become cluttered and disorganized with outdated, duplicate, or irrelevant content. This can make it difficult for your team to find and access the information they need, leading to confusion and frustration. To avoid this, make it a resolution to declutter your data repository in the new year. This means identifying and removing unnecessary content, consolidating duplicates, and organizing your files logically and intuitively.

### Evaluate and assess your content security policy

It is important to regularly evaluate and assess your organization's contents security and access control policy. Preventing unauthorized access is critical to security and data privacy laws compliance. In the new year, make it a resolution to take control of information across your organization by reviewing your content security policy to ensure it is up to date. This can involve reviewing your access controls, password policies, and data management protocols and conducting regular audits and risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Import all your content into the repository

If you're still using a mix of physical and digital content, now is the time to import all your organizational content into a single repository of your ECM system. This means scanning and importing all your physical documents, as well as digital contents, on local computers of employees or network storage devices, into the ECM. If you are not doing this, you are simply wasting the capabilities an Enterprise Content Management system can offer you.

### Review and optimize your current processes

An ECM system can help you streamline your business processes and improve efficiency, but only if it is used correctly. Take the time to review and optimize your current processes and workflows, particularly those pertaining to your enterprise's contents and data. This can involve improving document searchability with metadata, modifying electronic forms to better reflect current needs, training your team on how to use the ECM system effectively, implementing new features and tools, and regularly reviewing and updating your processes to ensure they are still relevant and effective.

Implementing these resolutions can help you make the most of your ECM system in the new year and improve the efficiency and productivity of your business.
