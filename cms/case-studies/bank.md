  This bank had more than 95TB of compressed records data needing to be located,
  extracted, normalized, and migrated ready to view in CMOD and FileNet without
  decompressing at any point. These records were in an extensive variety of line
  types and sources and needed to be consolidated for storage space and
  consistency of access. Almost all of this data was highly sensitive, meaning
  that offline migration hardware services with end-to-end encryption both in
  motion and at rest was required.


  Additionally, a significant majority of the data was static records, including
  invoices and deposits, account holder records, and other sensitive financial
  data. These records were to be very infrequently accessed and never changed,
  but must be kept ready for quick location and reference. Due to new GDPR
  regulations, it was also necessary to introduce a means by which any data
  pertaining to a specific account holder invoking their GDPR Right to be
  Forgotten could be deleted from a compressed text-only print stream archive
  without extracting the data and without affecting other records within that
  stream, which required a highly precise and complex byte offset measurement
  solution.


  All of this data had to be made available for rapid federated search across
  various storage locations and formats, with support for search based on any
  metadata or filters. Upon locating the relevant data from potentially many
  different locations, the data was to be packaged up into any selected document
  format such as PDF, with compliant branding and legal information applied, and
  then served up on-demand. This would enable user and customer self-service.


  Finally, due to the massive amount of data and legal implications should any
  discrepancies, errors, or loss of data integrity occur, this bank required a
  comprehensive audit trail with full chain of custody for every unit of data
  touched by the migration project.
f_results-2: "In total, more than 2.4\_billion unique documents were collated, condensed, and combined as well as normalized for line types by the Helix Massive Archival Retrieval System (MARS)\_migration platform before being ingested into the consolidated destination solution.\n\nHelix saved this bank more than 5 times the total project cost within the first year due to retiring the licensing fee of the source ECM solution and the massive reduction in computational and storage requirements once the data was normalized and disparate data combined into the minimum necessary number of distinct documents and reports. The entire project was completed within 11 months of contract signing, including pilot and handover. The client issued an award to the Helix team in recognition of their performance as well as their rapid turnaround on identifying, unloading, resolving, and re-loading 44 million erroneous records from the client.\n\nFull end-to-end encryption and a full audit trail with comprehensive chain of custody tracking was provided, proving yet another flawless enterprise content migration and ETL\_execution for Helix International."

f_solutions: "Helix International was uniquely qualified to solve this bank's needs due to the proprietary Helix MARS migration platform. While alternative options do exist, the Helix MARS\_platform features several unique and differentiating advantages, such as the ability to extract, read, normalize, and manipulate data from proprietary format archives without decompression, as well as the built-in option for end-to-end encryption of data both in motion and at rest, and a built-in audit trail with full chain of custody. The platform includes 45 unique extractors for every legacy ECM commonly utilized by enterprises.\n\nHelix International's unique approach to ECM\_migrations and retirement of legacy ECM\_solutions has saved over one trillion dollars to date for more than 500 enterprises, and is one of the many reasons why Helix International is IBM's premium partner of choice for ECM and ETL\_projects."
