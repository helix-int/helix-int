f_challenge-2: "This insurance company had more than 2.36 billion pages of records data needing to be located, extracted, normalized, indexed, and mapped to their new FileNet solution, as well as more than 420TB\_of compressed data that needed to be migrated and ready to view in FileNet without decompressing at any point. Almost all of this data was highly sensitive, meaning that offline migration hardware services with end-to-end encryption both in motion and at rest was required.\n\nAdditionally, a significant majority of the data was static records, including invoices, member records, and other sensitive financial data. These records were to be very infrequently accessed and never changed, but must be kept ready for quick location and reference. Due to new GDPR regulations, it was also necessary to introduce a means by which any data pertaining to a specific member invoking their GDPR Right to be Forgotten could be deleted from a compressed text-only print stream archive without extracting the data and without affecting other records within that stream, which required a highly precise and complex byte offset measurement solution.\n\nAll of this data had to be made available for rapid federated search across various storage locations and formats, with support for search based on any metadata or filters. Upon locating the relevant data from potentially many different locations, the data was to be packaged up into any selected document format such as PDF, with compliant branding and legal information applied, and then served up on-demand. This would enable user and customer self-service.\n\nFinally, due to the massive amount of data and legal implications should any discrepancies, errors, or loss of data integrity occur, this insurance company required a comprehensive audit trail with full chain of custody for every unit of data touched by the migration project.\n\nIn order to significantly reduce migration costs, Helix International migrated only the most recent, frequently accessed, and dynamic data to FileNet, leaving the static data in its original storage location. Helix deployed it's proprietary RealTime\_Viewer (RTV) to replace the legacy Documentum viewer."
f_results-2: "In total, more than 420TB\_of compressed data was successfully discovered, extracted, normalized, and optimized by the Helix Massive Archival Retrieval System (MARS)\_migration platform. Additionally, more than 2.36 billion pages of records were successfully indexed and mapped to FileNet from various archives, programs, and repositories.\n\nBy utilizing RTV to circumvent the original ECM, viewer, and APIs, Helix saved this insurance company more than $5MM within the first year and allowed them to close an entire data center that was no longer needed following the project's completion, due to the massive reduction in computational and storage requirements once the data was normalized, collated, and combined. This savings emerged from a combination of savings against the licensing fee renewal of the legacy ECM and viewer, as well as the closure of the data center and other cost reductions. This savings more than offset the cost of the entire migration project within the first year since contract signing, with ongoing savings forever thereafter.\n\nFull end-to-end encryption and a full audit trail with comprehensive chain of custody tracking was provided, proving yet another flawless enterprise ETL\_execution for Helix International."

f_solutions: "Helix International was uniquely qualified to solve this insurance company's needs due to the proprietary Helix MARS migration platform. While alternative options do exist, the Helix MARS\_platform features several unique and differentiating advantages, such as the ability to extract, read, normalize, and manipulate data from archives without decompression, as well as the built-in option for end-to-end encryption of data both in motion and at rest, and a built-in audit trail with full chain of custody. The platform includes 45 unique extractors for every legacy ECM commonly employed by enterprises.\n\nAdditionally, the Helix MARS\_platform features the proprietary RTV program, which allows for records data to be viewed in any format without need of migrating the data, and without need of the legacy ECM, viewer, or any of the associated licenses. This unique approach to ECM\_migrations and retirement of legacy ECM\_solutions has saved over one billion dollars to date for more than 500 enterprises, and is one of the many reasons why Helix International is IBM's premium partner of choice for ECM, ETL,\_and ESB projects."
