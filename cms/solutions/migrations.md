  *   Full Migration – all data is migrated from the source system to the target
  system.

  *   Ad Hoc migration – migration is done for specific data in a specific
  order.

  *   Partial Migration – archive the data and use Helix Real Time Viewer (RTV)
  to access the data.

  *   Assisted Migration – Helix International runs the pilot or Proof of
  Concept and trains the client team to complete the migration.

  All of the above is completed utilizing Helix International's on- and
  off-shore data engineers.


  All of the above can be mixed and matched together. You could fully migrate
  some data, move in a specific order other data, leave some in an archive and
  access using RTV, or migrate the remaining data yourself – or any other
  combination you require.


  ### Full Migration


  ![](/assets/external/62f8e6f2eb2ac1c281372c7a_full-migration.png)


  All selected data is migrated from the source repository to the target
  repository. Massive heterogenous data is extracted from various different
  devices and/or platforms and consolidated into one easy-to-use system. No need
  to manually perform sorting, as the MARS platform automates this process.

  ### Ad Hoc Migration

  Helix international will cooperates in setting technical and business rules
  for re-prioritizing your data organization. Data is migrated in move groups to
  allow for required data to be made available to the users from the source
  repository to the target repository as soon as possible. This might be for a
  specific group of customers or documents in a designated date range.

  ### Federation with RealTime Viewer (RTV)


  ![](/assets/external/62f8e8aab5d672b1cbd7f818_rtv.png)


  Data is not migrated but is stored in an archive, the source system software
  is turned off saving the licensing fee and the data is available to the user
  using Helix International RealTime Viewer. Data repositories have got larger
  over the years and when we first started with Migrations 15 years ago we used
  to migrate all of the data. Now we can archive the data and make it available
  without having to migrate the data over a period of many years. An example of
  a real client situation is that the data would have taken us over 3 years to
  migrate to the new repository but Helix International made the data available
  from the archive in a little over 4 months! You can see that the savings here
  can be enormous not only do you save the license fee but very little time
  needs to be spent to make the data available to the end user as only the Meta
  data is migrated to the target system. Real Time Viewer (RTV) is a migration
  component form the Helix International software portfolio that utilizes a
  compact filter that helps end users find their needed files faster. Simply
  enter the right values on search fields to prompt accurate data search.

  ### Assisted Migration

  Helix International will run the pilot / proof of concept and train the client
  staff to use Helix International migration tools. This is an excellent option
  for clients that have technical staff that have extensive experience of
  migrating data repositories. However it must be noted that for clients that do
  not have the experience of migrating that the time to migrate can be extended
  due to the inexperience. It is always the exceptions in the data, annotations
  and transforms that cause the issue and Helix International staff have the
  expertise, knowledge and experience to resolve the exceptions in a timely
  manner.

  ### On Shore & Off Shore Team Enables 24x7x365 Migrations

  Businesses in the global marketplace cross not only borders but also time
  zones. To facilitate more flexible transactions, on-shore/off-shore data
  migration is the solution.
