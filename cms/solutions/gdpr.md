Do you have a strategy for GDPR?
--------------------------------

### EU General Data Protection Regulation

The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas.

The aim of GDPR is to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches. It applies to all companies processing the personal data of data subjects residing in the Union, regardless of the company’s location.

GDPR also applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects in the EU by a controller/processor not established in the EU, irrespective of whether payment is required, and the monitoring of behavior that takes place within the EU.
