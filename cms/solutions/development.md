  ### SOAP or REST


  SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State
  Transfer) are both web service communication protocols. REST is preferred over
  SOAP as it is faster, lighter, cleaner and easier to learn and implement. In
  addition to using HTTP for simplicity, REST offers a number of other benefits
  over SOAP:


  *   REST allows a greater variety of data formats, whereas SOAP only allows
  XML

  *   Coupled with JSON (which typically works better with data and offers
  faster parsing), REST is generally considered easier to work with

  *   Thanks to JSON, REST offers better support for browser clients

  *   REST provides superior performance, particularly through caching for
  information that’s not altered and not dynamic

  *   It is the protocol used most often for major services such as Yahoo, Ebay,
  Amazon, and even Google

  *   REST is generally faster and uses less bandwidth. It’s also easier to
  integrate with existing websites with no need to refactor site infrastructure.
  This enables developers to work faster rather than spend time rewriting a site
  from scratch. Instead, they can simply add additional functionality.


  ### IBM RESTify


  *   IBM RESTify is a turn-key solution offering a single and universal
  REST-Web Service interface to integrate to CMOD and other repositories

  *   RESTify exposes the entire RTV accessible repositories with a simple http
  call

  *   All technologies can talk to RESTify easily using simple http calls that
  drive logon, open folder, search and retrieve creating a method for simple
  access (federated search)

  *   RESTify uses signed requests for authentication. Every application must
  have an access+secret key pair

  *   Services can be added, deleted and updated without downtime

  *   Can be configured to work with multiple repositories

  *   RESTify uses many optimization mechanisms such as caching and connection
  pooling when communicating with repositories
