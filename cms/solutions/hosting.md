  ### **Virtual Servers**


  Virtual servers are scalable and come with dedicated core and memory
  allocations. They are a great option if you are looking for compute resources,
  that can be added in minutes, with access to features like image templates.
  The hypervisor is fully managed by the Cloud, and you can perform
  configuration and management tasks by using both the IBM Cloud infrastructure
  customer portal and the API. Virtual servers are deployed to the same VLANs as
  physical servers, allowing you to spread workloads across virtual servers and
  bare metal servers, while maintaining interoperability. Virtual servers are
  fully customizable when you order them, with options to scale up as your
  compute needs grow.


  **Public virtual servers:** multi-tenant virtual server deployments give you
  rapid scalability and higher cost effectiveness with pre-defined sizes.


  **Transient virtual servers:** you call it “spot” pricing. We call it
  transient. This multitenant environment offers unused capacity at lower
  prices. When resources are needed, the workloads are deprovisioned.


  **Reserved virtual servers:** reserve up to 20 specific virtual server
  instances for guaranteed capacity.


  **Dedicated virtual servers:** single-tenant with rapid provisioning and
  flexibility, enabling virtual server placement control for workloads requiring
  physical isolation.

### Bare metal servers

These are known as single-tenant physical servers or managed dedicated servers. A business can run dedicated servers in its own data center or a Helix International colocation center, or rent them on an hourly or monthly subscription basis.
